## drum-kit ##

This is a drum kit web application built using HTML/CSS and JavaScript. The user presses one of 9 keys on the keyboard (A, S, D, F, G, H, J, K, L) to play one of 9 different drum sounds. On pressing a key, the application uses a visual transition to indicate which key was pressed and plays the corresponding sound.
